This directory exists for any modifications you might want to add to the game.

To load a different mod, pass it as an argument to the ```mod``` flag

```
    OpenHoW.exe -mod example
```

And then the game will attempt to load resources from the <base>/mods/example/ first before falling back
to the directory listed as dependency.
